# Foundry Stablecoin

This project was a follow along from lesson 12 of Patrick Collins' 27 Hour Solidity Course!!!
A lot of this code at the moment might be kinda Jank especially around my unit and fuzz tests >.< but i learned a ton following along :3
Would love to refactor this once i'm more well versed with my understanding of solidity and foundry.
Pls enjoy and would love some feedback on what i can do better!
